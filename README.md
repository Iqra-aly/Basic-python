# Python Concepts: Loops, Functions, If-Else, Data Structures, and Algorithms
# Overview
This file provides a simple explanation of key Python concepts such as loops, functions, if-else statements, data structures (like lists and dictionaries), and basic algorithms.

# Concepts
# 1. Loops
Loops allow for repeating a block of code multiple times. There are two main types:

For Loop: Runs a block of code a specific number of times or over a sequence.
 While Loop: Repeats as long as a certain condition is true.
# 2. Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They can take inputs, perform operations, and return a result.

# 3. If-Else Statements
If-else statements allow decisions to be made in the code. They check a condition, and based on whether it's true or false, execute different blocks of code.

# 4. Data Structures
Data structures help organize and manage data efficiently. Two commonly used data structures are:

# List: An ordered collection of items.
Dictionary: A collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and linked to a value.
# 5. Algorithms
An algorithm is a step-by-step process for solving a problem or performing a task. Algorithms can vary in complexity, from simple calculations to sorting large datasets.
